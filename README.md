# RPLS

# Overview

This is an implementation of rock, paper, scissors, lizzard, Spock. Game play is similar to rock, paper, scissors with the added complexity that the lizard and Spock bring into the equation.

Writing this gave me a chance to gain a little insight into C++. After completing this project I have learned that, while this language is vastly different than what I am used to using, I can see some of the benefit of using this language over others.

# Development Environment

This was written in Xcode 14.2 on a MacBook Air (M1) running macOS 12.5.

There was only one library beyond stlib that I used and it is time.h. This was used so that I could use srand to allow the computer to give "random" input using the clock as a seed.
